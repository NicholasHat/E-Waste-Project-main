Lithium-ion (Li-ion) Batteries
How to keep your battery in great conditon*<div class='text'>AVOID FULL DISCHARGES: Try not to let the battery drain completely; keep it between 20% and 80% charged. <br>KEEP COOL: Store and use the laptop in a cool environment as high temperatures can degrade the battery. <br>USE CORRECT CHARGER: Always use the manufacturer's charger to avoid damage. <br>CALIBRATE OCCACIONALLY Every few months allow the battery to fully discharge and then fully recharge to recalibrate the battery meter.</div>
How to properly dispose*<div class='text'>Do not throw these batteries in the regular trash. Take them to a designated e-waste recycling facility or a battery recycling drop-off location. Many electronics stores offer recycling programs for lithium-ion batteries. Check if the manufacturer has a take-back program for old batteries.</div>
Lithium Polymer (LiPo) Batteries
How to keep your battery in great conditon*<div class='text'>AVOID FULL DISCHARGES: Try not to let the battery drain completely; keep it between 20% and 80% charged. <br>AVOID HIGH TEMPERATURES: LiPo batteries are sensitive to heat so avoid using the laptop on soft surfaces that can block airflow. <br>REGULAR USE: If the laptop is not used for extended periods charge it periodically to maintain battery health.</div>
How to properly dispose*<div class='text'>Do not throw these batteries in the regular trash. Find a specialized battery recycling facility that accepts LiPo batteries* as they may have specific requirements due to their chemical composition. Before disposal* discharge the battery to a safe level (usually around 3.7 volts) to minimize risks.</div>
Nickel-Metal Hydride (NiMH) Batteries
How to keep your battery in great condition*<div class='text'>AVOID DEEP DISCHARGES: Do not let the battery discharge completely; try to keep it between 30% and 70% charged. <br>CHARGE REGULARLY: Charge frequently rather than waiting for it to drain; regular use helps prevent the memory effect. <br>STORE PROPERLY: If you need to store a NiMH battery do so in a cool and dry place at about 40% charge.</div>
How to properly dispose*<div class='text'>Do not throw these batteries in the regular trash. Many recycling centers accept NiMH batteries. Check for local programs or battery recycling drop-off points. Some areas have HHW collection events that accept NiMH batteries.</div>
Lead-Acid Batteries
How to keep your battery in great condition*<div class='text'>AVOID DEEP DISCHARGES: Do not let the battery discharge completely; try to keep it between 30% and 70% charged. <br>REGULAR CHARGING: Keep the battery charged; itâ€™s best to use it regularly and avoid leaving it idle for long periods. <br>CHECK FLUID LEVLES: For sealed lead-acid batteries ensure they remain well-ventilated and check for any signs of corrosion or damage.</div>
How to properly dispose*<div class='text'>Do not throw these batteries in the regular trash. Most auto parts stores and recycling centers will accept lead-acid batteries for recycling. Some regions have specific regulations regarding lead-acid battery disposal so check local laws for compliance.</div>

Intel CPU
Keeping your CPU in Good Condition*<div class='text'>Most CPUs should be treated the same for keeping it in good condition. The differences come based on what you're using your computer for and how powerful it is determining it's intensity.<br><br>ENSURE ADEQUATE COOLING: Invest in a good CPU cooler (air or liquid) to maintain optimal temperatures. Also replace thermal past eif it's dried out, typically every few years to improve heat transfer.<br>MONITOR TEMPERATURES: Using tools like HWMonitor or Core Temp you can track your CPU temperature. Aim to keep temperature cool. Also you can use BIOS settings or software to adjust fan speeds to enhance cooling when needed.<br>KEEP THE SYSTEM CLEAN: Clean dust and dirt from case, fans, and heatsinks to prevent overheating. You can use compressed air to blow out dust. Also make sure to keep cables tidy to improve airflow within a PC.<br>UPDATE BIOS AND DRIVERS: Regularly check for BIOS updates and the latest chipset drivers from intel to optimize and improve stability and performance.</div>
Recycle or Repurpose your CPU*<div class='text'>Before getting rid of your CPU make sure to ensure that any data has been wiped to protect personal information.<br><br>Intel does not have a specific trade-in program. But companies like Best Buy, Amazon, and Newegg offer store credit and trade-in offers for old CPUS.
